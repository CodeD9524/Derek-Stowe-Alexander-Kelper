        <h2>About</h2>
        <p> I am a Sagittarius, a martial artist spiritual, but I don't have all the answers. I'm just trying to find my
            own way. All I do is help other people give them advice about what they do to find peace while trying to
            find it myself I believe there are different types of peace. There's peace in your own life, but then there
            is peace in relationships too, as well as happiness. I am a goofball. I'm laid-back. I don't take things too
            seriously I mean I am it counts, but for the most part, not life is too short, so don't stress about it.</p>
